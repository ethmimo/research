Welcome to the Mimo research repo.

## Guide
This is where my research on Mimo and decentralized identity will live. So if you want to be notified of updates in my research I suggest you watch this repo to get notifications.

Navigating this repo is pretty simple. There's the main *README* (this), the *Interim* folder and the *Longterm* folder.

For more frequent updates you'll want to follow me on Twitter (@ghiliweld), I often post threads with updates on my research since I like to buidl in public.

If you don't want to see verbose updates you can just head on over to **Interim**. That folder has the interim solutions I'm currently working on. They're interim because they either have problems concerning privacy, high costs or decentralization. They'll do the job for now but are not optimal for the longterm vision I have for Mimo.

**Longterm** is where I share the longterm vision for Mimo, a lot of the things talked about in there would highly theoretical and unfeasible with current tech. They hold ideal solutions that would solve decentralization of one's identity, be free to alter, be private by default and simple to use/integrate.

## Research
My research is focused creating an identity standard that is:

- decentralized (can't be shut down)
- private (access to info is authorized by owner)
- free to alter (no gas costs)
- easy to use (from a UX and DX standpoint)

The are no current solutions to these problems without waiting for the tech to catch up (infrastructure wise) or without sacrificing decentralization.

In the long-term I'd rather wait for the proper infrastructure but in the next 2-3 months and year I would probably ship somewhat centralized systems.

The end goal within the next 2-3 months is to have a demo that can satisfy the _Minimal Viable Goal_ of Mimo, which is to have **an identity that belongs to you and cannot my taken down**.

Said demo will probably have costs associated with it (gas fees) and will be slightly centralized, but privacy and ease of use are essentials that shall never be sacrificed.

I invite you to check out the [interim](https://github.com/ethmimo/research/tree/master/interim) folder to see what's cooking in the lab!
