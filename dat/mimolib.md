## Where Does Mimo Come In?
If user info and app code are hosted by the users, where does Mimo come in?

Mimo will provide a specification for DWeb Apps to use when creating their apps, such that every app uses the same standard and users can benefit from the freedom of porting their info to any app of their choosing.
Additionally, Mimo will also provide an API on top of WebDB, similar to [LibFritter](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/libfritter). This will help app developers build their apps on Beaker.
