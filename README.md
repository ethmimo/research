# Mimo Research

Welcome to the Mimo research repo.

## Guide
This is where my research on Mimo and decentralized identity will live. So if you want to be notified of updates in my research I suggest you watch this repo to get notifications.

Navigating this repo is pretty simple. There's the main *README* (this), the *e-contracts* folder and the *protocol* folder.

For more frequent updates you'll want to follow me on Twitter (@ghiliweld), I often post threads with updates on my research since I like to buidl in public.

**E-contracts** is where I share my general research on e-contracts.

**Protocol** is where I share research on features in the Mimo protocol and how they'll be implemented.

## Research
My research is focused creating an identity standard that is:

- decentralized (can't be shut down)
- private (access to info is authorized by owner)
- free to alter (no gas costs)
- easy to use (from a UX and DX standpoint)
- has human readable IDs

## Requirements
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to create many identities.
- [x] Identities **SHOULD NOT** be able to be linked by a common user.
- [x] Identifiers **MUST** must be human-readable.
- [x] Identifiers **NEED NOT** be truly unique if we can verify the true owner of a name.
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to access their identity across many apps.
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to use Mimo without anything more than a keypair.
- [ ] Mimo **SHOULD** work with as many wallets and data storage layers as possible.
- [ ] Users **MUST** be able to share private data as intuitively and safely as possible.
- [ ] Users **MUST** be able to do anything with their identities, including transferring it to another keypair.
- [ ] Users **SHOULD** be able to delegate certain actions to other third-parties if desired.
- [ ] Users **SHOULD** be able to recover their identities intuitively.
