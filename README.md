# Mimo Research

Welcome to the Mimo research repo.

## Guide
This is where my research on Mimo and decentralized identity will live. So if you want to be notified of updates in my research I suggest you watch this repo to get notifications.

Navigating this repo is pretty simple. There's the main *README* (this), the *Interim* folder and the *Longterm* folder.

For more frequent updates you'll want to follow me on Twitter (@ghiliweld), I often post threads with updates on my research since I like to buidl in public.

If you don't want to see verbose updates you can just head on over to **Interim**. That folder has the interim solutions I'm currently working on. They're interim because they either have problems concerning privacy, high costs or decentralization. They'll do the job for now but are not optimal for the longterm vision I have for Mimo.

**Longterm** is where I share the longterm vision for Mimo, a lot of the things talked about in there would highly theoretical and unfeasible with current tech. They hold ideal solutions that would solve decentralization of one's identity, be free to alter, be private by default and simple to use/integrate.

## Research
My research is focused creating an identity standard that is:

- decentralized (can't be shut down)
- private (access to info is authorized by owner)
- free to alter (no gas costs)
- easy to use (from a UX and DX standpoint)
- has human readable IDs

## Requirements
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to create many identities.
- [x] Identities **SHOULD NOT** be able to be linked by a common user.
- [x] Identifiers **MUST** must be human-readable.
- [x] Identifiers **NEED NOT** be truly unique if we can verify the true owner of a name.
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to access their identity across many apps.
- [x] Users **MUST** be able to use Mimo without anything more than a keypair.
- [ ] Mimo **SHOULD** work with as many wallets and data storage layers as possible.
- [ ] Users **MUST** be able to share private data as intuitively and safely as possible.
- [ ] Users **MUST** be able to do anything with their identities, including transferring it to another keypair.
- [ ] Users **SHOULD** be able to delegate certain actions to other third-parties if desired.
- [ ] Users **SHOULD** be able to recover their identities intuitively.
